# Nasaapp
This app uses the nasa API to display media files (images and videos) of space, and descriptions about them.
The user can search for images using a keyword, save images to their favourites page.

# Home
The home page shows a randome daily image from the nasa archives with description of what is seen.

# Search
The user can search for images by keywords and LIKE them if they wish to, adding the images to the favourites page.

# Favourites
The user can see all the images that were saved from the Search page - remove by DISLIKE (and add them right back, as the image moves to the bottom of the screen in real-time but isn't removed until the page is refreshed).
